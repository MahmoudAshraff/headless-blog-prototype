It returns Promises, making it perfect for use with <code>async/await</code> for clean, readable code. This is the exact method we use in this project to simulate fetching data from a CMS.</p><h3>Why use Vanilla JS?</h3><p>Understanding the DOM and native browser APIs is the foundation for any framework. This project demonstrates strong core skills, ensuring you're not just relying on a framework's abstraction layer.</p>",

Changing a single variable instantly updates the entire site, which is essential for theme toggling or branding updates.</p>",
